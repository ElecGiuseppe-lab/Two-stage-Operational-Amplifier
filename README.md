# Two stage operational amplifier

## Abstract

This paper addresses the design of a multistage operational amplifier that, unlike a single-stage amplifier, is capable of delivering higher performance by meeting three important amplifier specifications:
* High input resistance
* High gain
* Low output resistance  
Specifically, the objective is to design a two-stage operational amplifier with differential input, using the Cadence tool, that meets certain design specifications in terms of supply voltage, gain, unity gain frequency (GBW), stability margin, maximum power dissipation, etc.
All the connections between the OP-AMP's performance and the parameters that can be adjusted are established in order to derive a series of recommendations for the correct sizing of its component transistors. All transistors must operate in the saturation region for the circuit to function properly.
